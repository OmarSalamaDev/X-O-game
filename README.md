# X-O game
This is an XO game I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice and enhance my skills in JavaScript and DOM manipulation.<br/><br/>The game features two modes:<br/>
- <i>2-player mode:</i> where two players can compete against each other.
- <i>Computer mode:</i> where the player plays against the computer, implemented using a simple algorithm I developed.</br></br>
